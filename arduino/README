pypilot can communicate with arduinos over serial port

motor - motor controller   binary checksum 4 byte protocol (38400 baud)
        used by pypilot to control motor
weather sensors - nmea0183 wind, presure and air temp (38400 baud)



NOTE, if BAD_FUSES flag is raised, it because the
cheapest arduino clones sometimes has wrong fuses set:

load arduino isp sketch to one arduino to program another, connect 6 wires as described in arduinoisp sketch

read fuses
avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328p -U hfuse:r:-:h -U lfuse:r:-:h -U efuse:r:-:h -U lock:r:-:h

0xda
0xff
0x5
0xf

If you get different values, you must correct them such as:

avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m328p -U efuse:w:0x4:m
